# LINK Token Contracts

The LINK token is an [EIP20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md) token with additional [ERC677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677) functionality.

The total supply of the token is 1,000,000,000, and each token is divisible up to 18 decimal places.

To prevent accidental burns, the token does not allow transfers to the contract itself and to 0x0.

Security audit for [0.4 version of the contracts](./contracts/v0.4/) is available [here](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/4aa88041bd6e34835b8c0fd051245e79).

## Details

- Decimals: 18
- Name: ChainLink Token
- Symbol: LINK

## Setup

The project contains [0.4 contracts](./contracts/v0.4/) that were used for LINK Ethereum Mainnet deployment in 2017. For deployments moving forward, we use the updated [0.6 contracts](./contracts/v0.6/) which use a more recent version of solc and the OpenZeppelin token standards. These updates include a minor ABI change around approval/allowance naming.

To mitigate supply chain attack type of risk, we currently avoid using NPM modules to pull Solidity vendor code, but instead use git submodules. Make sure you pull submodules explicitly:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

After submodules are updated, we can run:

```bash
yarn
```

Setup contracts:

```bash
yarn setup
```

**NOTICE:** This will compile all versions of the contracts, but as Hardhat doesn't have robust support for multiple Solidity versions the resulting artifacts will include only final (latest) compiler output. To make sure you compile the specific version please use the specific command:

Setup v0.6 contracts using Solidity 0.6 compiler:

```bash
build:contracts:0.6
```

### ABI

- [v0.4](./build/artifacts/contracts/v0.4)
- [v0.6](./build/artifacts/contracts/v0.6)
- [v0.7](./build/artifacts/contracts/v0.7)

You can also find interfaces and ABIs after running through the install `yarn setup` process.

## Testing

Run tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

This will run unit tests for all versions of the contracts.

## Integration testing

Integration tests are currently setup for Optimism contracts, and to run them make sure you have a local network running first.

The network can be started using a helpful script, which will clone the [Optimism monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), build the :

```bash
yarn script:oe:up
```

Run tests:

```bash
yarn test --network optimism
```

This will run unit tests for all versions of the contracts, plus supported integration tests against the local L1 & L2 networks.

The network can be stopped using another script:

```bash
yarn script:oe:down
```

Or use the clean script, which will also delete all the images:

```bash
yarn script:oe:clean
```
